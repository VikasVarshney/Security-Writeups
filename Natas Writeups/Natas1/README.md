# [Natas 1](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/natas1.html "Natas 1 Web Challenge Page")


We use the password from the previous challenge to log into Natas 1. After logging in, the challenge says:

`You can find the password for the next level on this page, but rightclicking has been blocked!`

Since rightclicking is blocked, we can either use a proxy to see the source code, or simply press CTRL + U, to get the page source. 
Doing so, we find the password for natas2:

`<!--The password for natas2 is ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi -->`


With that password, we can now log into [Natas2](https://github.com/ProDigySML/Security-Writeups/blob/master/Natas%20Writeups/Natas2 "Natas 2")
